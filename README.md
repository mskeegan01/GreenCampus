# GreenCampus
We have built a fully automated indoor-farm for herbs and spices developed with an Arduino-Shield, IoT Devices, and Artifical-Light. 

The purpose of this project is to create a fully automated indoor-farm. One can plant herbs or spices of all kinds.
By using artificial light (spectral colors: red, blue) one can increase the nutrition value of edible plants.

For example:

Vitamin C
Provitamin A (Antioxidants)
Amount of Fibre

Further, we developed a farming-box which offers perfect conditions for any edible plants to grow quicker than under normal conditions. Besides, we are able to harvest already after 3 weeks instead of 5 weeks and in a higher amount.

The ideology behind it is to supply our Campus with healthy foods (add-ons) for our salads, teas or even as a supplement. The goal is to increase our overall health and even to decrease the chance of getting sick
